# Mock Data Holder (Java)

## Overview

The Mock Data Holder (Java) is a reference implementation of a CDR Data Holder solution, designed to support the Consumer Data Right (CDR) implementation journey. It aims to assist CDR participants in developing their own Data Holder (DH) systems that comply with Consumer Data Standards.

## **Using the** Mock Data Holder

The Data Standards Body provides a cloud-based instance of the Mock Data Holder (Java) and a comprehensive Postman collection in a public workspace. Using this setup, users can to easily interact with and explore CDR APIs using the collection without local setup.

This solution:

- is maintained regularly to ensure compatibility with the latest Consumer Data Standards.
- assists Data Holders with regulatory adherence through accurate request and response simulations.
- provides Docker Support to simplify deployment and testing across various environments, with ready-to-use Docker images available on DockerHub, eliminating the need for local builds.
- provides ORM (JPA) support with [H2 database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) to demonstrate an end-to-end API endpoint implementation.
- strictly follows the [CDS Guidelines](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#http-headers) for handling the request and response HTTP headers accurately.
- utilises test data generated by the Test Data CLI Tool for populating the database to mimic various real-world scenarios for thorough testing.

You can set up a local instance of the Mock Data Holder (Java) for customised and extended use cases. For more information, refer to the **Local Setup and Customisation** section below.

## Local Setup and Customisation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Git, for cloning the repository.
- Java 8 (JDK 1.8)
- Maven 3

### Installation

1. Create a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/mock-data-holder-java/). To do this, click the **Fork** button in the top right corner of the GitHub [repository home page](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/mock-data-holder-java/).

2. After forking the repository, clone it to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
    ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `project-name` with the name of your repository.

3. Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory by running:

    ```
    cd project-name
    ```

   Replace `project-name` with the name of the repository.


### Build

1. Customise the project as needed for your specific use case.
2. Navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```shell
mvn install
```

### Run

1. Start the development server by running the following command in the project directory:

    ```shell
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

   or

    ```
    java -jar target/mock-data-holder-java-x.x.x.jar
    ```

   Where `x.x.x` is the version, say, `2.5.0`

   The data will be loaded from the *payloads* directory.

   If you want to pass a [test data file](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/testdata-cli) to be loaded at start up:

    ```
    java -jar target/mock-data-holder-java-x.x.x.jar /your/local/path/to/testdata-cli/samples/output/u1-output.json
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8383](http://localhost:8383) to access the Mock Data Holder (Java) application. You should be able to see the Swagger UI page.

## Contribution Process

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow these simple steps:

1. Create a new branch for your work from the `master` branch:

    ```
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2. Begin making your changes or contributions.
3. Follow the instructions in the project repository to run and test your changes locally.
4. Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Open a pull request (PR) using the _dev_ branch in the [original repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/mock-data-holder-java/) as the destination branch. Include a detailed description of your changes and the problem you are addressing.
7. Engage in the discussion on your PR and make any necessary adjustments based on feedback from maintainers and other contributors.
8. Once your PR is approved and all tests pass, it will be merged into the project.

### Note:

1. Please ensure your contributions align with our project's objectives and [guidelines](https://d61cds.notion.site/Contribution-Guidelines-8b99d030fea946668fbc75444197e68b?pvs=4).

## Docker

Run the image from DockerHub:

```
docker run -p 8383:8383 consumerdatastandardsaustralia/mock-data-holder-java:x.x.x
```

or, if you want to point to your own keystore:

```
docker run -p 8383:8383 -v /your/local/path/to/mock-data-holder-java/keystore:/keystore consumerdatastandardsaustralia/mock-data-holder-java:x.x.x
```

If you want to pass a [test data file](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/testdata-cli) to be loaded at start up:

```
docker run -p 8383:8383 -v /your/local/path/to/testdata-cli/samples/output/u1-output.json:/testdata/u1-output.json consumerdatastandardsaustralia/mock-data-holder-java:x.x.x /testdata/u1-output.json
```

Where `x.x.x` is the version, say, `2.5.0`

Run locally-built image:

```
docker run -p 8383:8383 consumerdatastandardsaustralia/mock-data-holder-java:2.5.1-SNAPSHOT
```

## Testing

Our Postman collection includes pre-configured requests that mirror typical interactions with the Data Holder's APIs, and allows us to test functionality, response formats, and error handling seamlessly.
